# Small Spring Boot Projects

This repository contains 6 full-stack Spring Boot projects that I am working on while following tutorials to deepen my understanding and experience with Spring Boot. While I am already familiar with Spring and Spring Boot and have built several projects, including a microservices-based project, these additional projects will help me further solidify my knowledge and skills.

## Projects Overview

### Project 1: To-Do Application

**Technologies & Tools:**
- **Backend:**
  - Spring Boot
  - JPA (Hibernate) with MySQL
  - Lombok for reducing boilerplate code
- **Frontend:**
  - Thymeleaf for templating
  - Bootstrap for responsive and modern UI

This project is a simple To-Do application where users can create, read, update, and delete tasks. It demonstrates the use of Spring Boot with JPA/Hibernate for database interaction and Thymeleaf for server-side rendering of HTML templates.

### Project 2: Real-Time Chat Application

**Backend (Server Side):**
- Spring Boot
- Spring WebSocket for real-time communication
- Spring Messaging (STOMP protocol) for message brokering
- Thymeleaf for rendering the HTML templates

**Frontend (Client Side):**
- Thymeleaf for templating
- JavaScript (ES6) for dynamic frontend behavior
- SockJS for handling WebSocket connections
- Stomp.js for WebSocket communication
- HTML/CSS for structure and styling
- Bootstrap for modern, responsive design

The Real-Time Chat Application allows users to communicate with each other in real-time. It leverages WebSocket for full-duplex communication between the client and server, making it suitable for interactive chat features.
